# PySpark and LangChain RAG Pipeline with Gemini

This project is a proof-of-concept for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It uses PySpark for data processing and LangChain for chunking and vector storage, and then queries Google's Gemini Pro model to extract structured information from the retrieved text.
